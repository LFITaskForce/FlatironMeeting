## Rationale

The goal of this meeting is to gather developers and users of Likelihood-Free
Inference methods to share latest techniques, use cases and applications across
different fields, and discuss open challenges. Part of this workshop will also
be dedicated to a few hack days with the goal of seeding the development of a
common probabilistic programming framework for Likelihood-Free Inference as well
as collaboratively working on LFI-related hack projects.

Topics of interest:
  - Likelihood-Free Inference techniques
  - Density Estimation
  - Dimensionality reduction
  - Fast emulation
  - Posterior validation
