## Rationale

The goal of this interdisciplinary meeting is to gather developers and users of Likelihood-Free
Inference methods to share latest techniques, use cases and applications across
different fields, and discuss open challenges. The first two days of the workshop
will be focused on talks and discussions, while the remaining of the week will
be dedicated to a hackathon with the goal of seeding the development of a
common probabilistic programming framework for Likelihood-Free Inference as well
as collaboratively working on LFI-related hack projects.
