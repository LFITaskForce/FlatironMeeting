# Rationale

The goal of this meeting is to gather developers and users of Likelihood-Free
Inference methods to share latest techniques, use cases and applications across
different fields, and discuss open challenges. The first two days of the workshop
will be dedicated to talks and discussions, while the remaining of the week will
be dedicated to a few hack days with the goal of seeding the development of a
common probabilistic programming framework for Likelihood-Free Inference as well
as collaboratively working on LFI-related hack projects.

Topics of interest:
  - Likelihood-Free Inference techniques
  - Density Estimation
  - Dimensionality reduction
  - Fast emulation
  - Posterior validation
