Meeting website here: https://lfitaskforce.github.io/FlatironMeeting/

The goal of this interdisciplinary meeting is to gather developers and users of Likelihood-Free
Inference methods to share latest techniques, use cases and applications across
different fields, and discuss open challenges. Part of this workshop will also
be dedicated to a few hack days with the goal of seeding the development of a
common probabilistic programming framework for Likelihood-Free Inference as well
as collaboratively working on LFI-related hack projects.
